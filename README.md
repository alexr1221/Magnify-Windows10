# Magnify-Windows10
This script reproduces the functionality of the default magnify/zoom/loupe windows app, however you can choose which software is impacted. 

For example, if you want to only have the Opera browser being zoomed, you can define it and zooming will only apply to this browser. If you switch to a new app, zoom will be removed.

It will zoom in full-screen mode
