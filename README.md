# Magnify-Windows10
This script reproduces the functionality of the default magnify/zoom/loupe windows app, but in addition, you can choose which software the zoom is applied to. 

For example, if you want to zoom-in the Opera browser only, you can define it and zooming will only apply to this browser. If you switch to a new app, zoom will be removed.

It will zoom in full-screen mode
